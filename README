Pacostrano is just a bench of few scripts allowing me to set up, to debug and to deploy applications quickly on my server.
It is not really generic for the moment but I guess you can try to use it for small purpose, adapting some rules.

# INSTALLATION
Once you have capified your app, you have to tell Capistrano where are Pacostrano sources, so add inside the 'Capfile' file something like :
Dir['/path/to/pacostrano_sources/**/*.rb'].each { |source| load(source) }

# CONFIGURATION
Inside the Pacostrano sources, you have a file 'deploy_model.rb'. You should copy/paste that code inside the deploy.rb file of your application and so filled the various information required. Here you will set the main information for deployment.
Yet, as it can have a lot of informations inside the /config folder, in order not to overload the deply.rb file, Pacostrano is using a different process to load the config files. Regarding the configuration files (from /config), you have to put the config files you want to customize on the server inside the folder /config/server/config. So for example, the database description you want to have on the server should be set inside the file /config/server/config/database.yml. Pacostrano allows you later to upload directly these files to the server and to symlink automatically these files to the current deployment.
